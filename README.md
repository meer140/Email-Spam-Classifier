# Email-Spam-Classifier
Email Spam Classifier is a compact Python project that uses simple NLP preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, TF‑IDF) and classical scikit‑learn models (e.g., MultinomialNB or LogisticRegression) to detect spam in emails and short messages. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to understand, and quick to train for experimentation or small-scale deployment.
